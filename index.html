        <h2><b>What is Organic agriculture?</b> </h2>
        <p>
        Organic agriculture is a kind of diversified agriculture wherein crops and livestock are managed through the use of
        integrated technologies with a preference to depend on resources available either at the farm or locally. Or it may be
        defined as ‘an integrated farming system that strives for sustainability, the enhancement of soil fertility and
        biological diversity while, with rare exceptions, prohibiting synthetic pesticides, antibiotics, synthetic fertilisers,
        genetically modified organisms, and growth hormones.

        <h2><b>Aim of Organic Agriculture</b></h2>
        
             Organic agriculture is a holistic way of farming and besides the production of goods of high quality. It primarily aims
            at the conservation of natural resources like soil, water, climate, biodiversity, non-renewable energy, etc., for
            sustainable productivity in agriculture.<br>
            1. Sustainability of Natural Resources: Sustainability is used in a wider sense to encompass not just the conservation
            of non-renewable resources (soil, water, minerals, energy, biodiversity) but also issues of environmental and social
            sustainability. The very basic approach to organic agriculture are as follows:<br>
            a. Improve and maintain the natural landscape and agro-ecosystem.<br>
            b. Avoid overexploitation and pollution of natural resources.<br>
            c. Minimize consumption of non-renewable energy sources.<br>
            d. Maintain and improve soil health by stimulating the activity of soil organisms with organic manures and avoid harming
            them with pesticides.<br>
            e. Obtain optimum economic returns within a safe, secure and healthy working environment.<br>
            f. Acknowledge the virtues of indigenous knowledge and traditional farming systems (ITKs).<br>
            2. Minimizing Cost of Cultivation: Organic Agriculture is very important for resource-poor farmers, especially for those
            who are operating in high risk-prone areas of dryland and rainfed agriculture.<br>
            3. Healthy Food: Healthy food means food that is free from harmful chemicals and heavy elements, tasteful and
            nutritious. Organic agriculture has all feasible methods that are used to minimize pollution of not only farm products
            but also of the surrounding environment, including air, soil and water.<br>
            4. Augmentation of Profits: Organically produced foods have a great demand in export markets, especially those of
            European and North American countries, and they fetch a sizable premium, as compared to conventionally grown farm
            products. In the domestic sector, demand for organic food is increasing tremendously.<br>
            5. Improving Soil Health: Some of the important features of organic agriculture in the context of soil health and
            environmental protection are given here:<br>
            a. In organic agriculture, the supply of nutrients is more balanced, which helps to keep plants healthy and soil
            biological activity is enhanced, which improves nutrient mobilization from organic matter and native soil reserves and
            minimizes the losses of nutrients, thus protecting the environment.<br>
            b. Organic agriculture technologies increase the organic matter content of the soil, which has a positive effect on soil
            aggregation and water-holding capacity.<br><br>

        <h2><b>Practices Followed During Organic Agriculture.</b></h2>
        <p>
          <b>1. Enrichment of Soil:</b> Abandon the use of chemicals, use crop residue as mulch, use organic and biological fertilizers,
            adopt crop rotation and multiple cropping, avoid excessive tilling and keep the soil covered with a green cover or
            biological mulch.<br>
          <b>2. Management of Temperature:</b>  Keep soil covered, plant trees and bushes on the bund.<br>
          <b>3. Conservation of Soil and Rainwater:</b> Dig percolation tanks, maintain contour bunds in sloppy land and adopt contour row
            cultivation, dig farm ponds, maintain low height plantation on bunds.<br>
          <b>4. Harvesting of Sun Energy:</b> Maintain green stands throughout the year through a combination of different crops and
            plantation schedules.<br>
          <b>5. Self-reliance in inputs:</b> Develop your own seed, on-farm production of compost, vermicompost, vermiwash, liquid manures
            and botanical extracts.<br>
          <b>6. Maintenance of life forms:</b> Develop habitat for the sustenance of life forms, never use pesticides and create enough
            diversity.<br>
          <b>7. Integration of Animals:</b> Animals are important components of organic management and not only provide animal products but
            also provide enough dung and urine for use in soil.<br>
          <b>8. Use of Renewable Energy:</b> Use solar energy, bio-gas and bullock driven pumps, generators and other machines.<br>

        <h2><b>Benefits of Organic Agriculture</b></h2>
        <p>
          1. No chemical fertilizers, pesticides, weedicides and synthetic chemicals are used.<br>
          2. Organic food contains enough vitamins, proteins and minerals along with other nutrients.<br>
          3.  Organically grown food is free from contamination with health-harming chemicals.<br>
          4.  Increases soil nourishment by increasing soil organic matter.<br>
          5.  Organic agriculture also helps in the sequestration of more carbon than regular conventional farming.<br>
          6.  Lower production cost.<br>
          7.  Organic agriculture reduces energy requirements for production systems.<br>
          8.  Promotes environment-friendly practices like reduce, reuse and recycle.<br>
          9.  It provides employment to labour in rural areas.<br>

        <h2><b>Summary about Organic agriculture</b></h2>
        <p>
        The world demand for organic products is growing rapidly in developed countries like Europe, the USA, Japan and
        Australia. The organic agriculture export market is one of the major drivers of organic ogriculture in India. India
        exports 31, organic products. Organic systems are complex, but the products extracted through the method of organic
        farming are healthy, tasty and free from contaminations of pesticides. Organic farming holds the great promise to solve
        some of the environmental and social problems caused by conventional agriculture. To play this role at the global level,
        farmers need access to essential knowledge on efficient ways, sustainable means and support structures that encourage
        organic practices and incentives to adopt them.<br><br>
